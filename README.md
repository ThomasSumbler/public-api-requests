Treehouse Techdegree Project 5

## Description

This project requests data from a third party API (https://randomuser.me), and displays information about 12 "users" supplied by the API.

## Remarks

This project is intended as a JavaScript project, so the HTML and CSS files were provided.  Most of the page is generated with JavaScript, conforming to HTML templates (so that the CSS will work).  I made changes to the provided CSS files to make the following customizations:
1. Increased the Font Size of "Awesome Startup Employee Directory" heading.
2. Gave heading a grey shadow.
3. Increased the top margin of the search bar container for better alignment with heading.
4. Changed the background when the modal is active to a dark blue.
5. Added shadows to the modal boxes.
